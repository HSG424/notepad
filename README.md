# Notepad

A [notepad app](https://notepad-44bd1.web.app) developed using [React + Typescript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Since this is a practice exercise, I did not use ESLint and I did not write documentation or unit tests.

I could also have provided authentication and a more sophisticated data persistence layer that communicates with a back-end API.

Even manual optimizations such as lazy loading or React.memo were not needed considering the size and scale of this practice app.

Once again, the goal was to simply practice [React + Typescript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Live deployment: [https://notepad-44bd1.web.app](https://notepad-44bd1.web.app)
